# simpop
Simple (extremely!) population simulation - does 1 child per person mean a stable population?


Example run:


    rob@ScreamerIV:/mnt/d/proj/sim1$ ./simpop.py
    
    Running for 100 generations with starting population of 100
    Reproduction age is 2; death age is 8
     - At end of generation 0, population is 100
     - At end of generation 1, population is 200
     - At end of generation 2, population is 300
     - At end of generation 3, population is 400
     - At end of generation 4, population is 500
     - At end of generation 5, population is 600
     - At end of generation 6, population is 700
     - At end of generation 7, population is 750
     - At end of generation 8, population is 775
     - At end of generation 9, population is 787
     - At end of generation 10, population is 793
     - At end of generation 11, population is 796
     - At end of generation 12, population is 798
     - At end of generation 13, population is 799
     - At end of generation 14, population is 800
     - At end of generation 15, population is 800
     - At end of generation 16, population is 800
     - At end of generation 17, population is 800
     - At end of generation 18, population is 800
